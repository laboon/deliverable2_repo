Deliverable 2 Repo

##Bill's Directions

1. Set up git on your local machine, and create a (free) github account

2. Fork this repo (see the directions here if you don't know how to do this - [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) )

3. After you have completed the assignment, do NOT PR back to the original repo - simply push it your account 

4. In your paper, include a link to your repo (NOT mine)

##Will's Directions to Joey

1. Pull the changes I made.

2. Create a new Eclipse project. It should be empty.

3. Right click on the project you made. Select Build Path -> Link Source and select the location of our repo's `src` folder in your filesystem.

4. Do the same for `test`.

5. Inside `test`, right click on mockito.jar and add it to the build path.

6. You've just made symlinks to your copy of the `deliverable_2` repo from an Eclipse project. You can now edit from Eclipse and do nice Eclipse things without getting Eclipse cruft in our repo.

7. Profit
